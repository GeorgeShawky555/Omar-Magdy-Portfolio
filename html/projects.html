                Contract Employment usually offers a higher overall rate than hourly roles because contractors:
                Cover their own expenses (taxes, insurance).
                
                Lack traditional benefits.

                Hourly Employment may have a lower base rate but offers:
                Stability (consistent paycheck).
                
                Potential overtime pay.
